# Headline Analyzer

## Build a headline analysis tool that gives us the following info

- Word count -> done
- Character count -> done
- Words from a predefined Word Bank
- Formula check - check if it matches a well tested formula
- Sentiment
- Readability
- Analyze distrubution of word bank words and score


## Refactoring Requirements
- All tests should still pass
- Final output should still be the same - JSON string. Code to an interface
- Start with small changes
